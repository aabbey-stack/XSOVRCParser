# XSOVRCParser
WIP VRChat output log parser for more advanced users. I mostly use it for real time monitoring of avatar switches (against avatar crashers) and errors, but also has some quality of life 
features such as instance & player joins, leaves. Implementation of real time notifications in game through XSO notifications API is work in progress & doesn't work rn how it's supposed to.
